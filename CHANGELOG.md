## 2.5.7 (2007-08-17)

- Reformatting: converted tabs to spaces
- Added test program testenv.c using global environ variable as alternative
  to getenv()
  (2007-08-15, HA)
- Added output of some configuration settings with banner
- Switched off leak detection in shared library for any platform. Use the
  static library for finding leaks - with information where the piece of
  memory got allocated. Meanwhile I think leak-checking without further
  information is quite useless! Too many correct programs don't free
  all memory, cause the system frees memory up at program end. Thus,
  too many platforms/environments are reported "broken" from DUMA
- Output allocator type (malloc, strdup, ..) with leak report for each
  non freed memory block
- Removed option DUMA_USE_FRAMENO and the frameno variable; I suppose nobody
  is using it, but additionally it is not thread safe
- Added option DUMA_PREFER_GETENV; if you prefer standard C library getenv()
  over global char \*\*environ
- Added function duma_check(void\*) and its macro DUMA_CHECK(): it checks the
  No Mans Land - especially the unprotected end - of the memory block
- Added function duma_checkAll() and its macro DUMA_CHECKALL(): it checks
  the No Mans Land - especially the unprotected end - of all allocated
  memory blocks

  - caddr_t and u_int were already defined
  - use signals as on Linux/Unix in dumatest.c
  - updated Makefile
    (2007-07-13, HA)

## 2.5.2 (2007-07-12)

- Other minor corrections
- Added preprocessor option "DUMA_SEMAPHORES" to select pthreads, locking
  mechanism: semaphores or mutexes

    deallocation when variable set check if malloc() and free() are bound
    to efence
    (2005-07-15, HA)
- Integrated a patch from [Zbynek Vyskovsky](mailto:kvr@centrum.cz) in his
  words: "I modified Electric Efence a little, to be able to catch free-ing
  memory via watch point in debugger. The patch (attached) solves the
  problem when you are watching expression for change and suddenly
  realize the memory containing expression disappeared. It has no
  other effect, just makes debugging easier."
  (2005-07-11, HA)
- Bugfix for internal slot mode EFST_DEALLOCATED reported by Mikolas Patocka
  error occurred when userSpace memory region of freed memory is reused from
  system and freed again: efence claimed freeing already freed memory
  (2005-03-02, HA)
- Defining macros/functions also for str[n]cpy() and str[n]cat() checking for
  overlapping memory regions
  (2005-02-17, HA)
- Now defining macros/functions also for strdup(), memcpy()
- memcpy() checks if memory regions overlap
  (2005-02-16, HA)
- Added EF_OLD_DEL_MACRO preprocessor flag to keep compatibility to old
  DEL_ELEM() / DEL_ARRAY() macros; when not defined a macro for "delete"
  is defined which has standard conforming syntax
  (2005-02-14, HA)

## 2.4.13 (2005-02-11)

- Added internal flag saving the source (allocation/deallocation) for
  file name and lineno
- Added EF_OLD_NEW_MACRO preprocessor flag to keep compatibility to old
  NEW_ELEM() / NEW_ARRAY() macros. When not defined a macro for "new" is
  defined which has standard conform syntax. Unfortunately, you have to
  use DEL_ELEM/DEL_ARRAY further to utilize file name and line number
  of deallocation calls
  (2005-02-10, HA)
- Reworked/revised ALL internal functions !!!
- Freeing already freed memory is now detected (much better)
- Disallows coalescing memory regions and also stores
  \_\_FILE\_\_ and \_\_LINE\_\_ of free() to be able to print position
  of first free
- Added EF_USE_FRAMENO preprocessor flag. changed not to support
  EF_newFrame() and EF_delFrame() by default
  (2005-02-07, HA)
- Applied bug-fix posted by Luis Gonzalez. Bug was occurring under SuSE Linux
  9.1 when calling eftest with a higher number (such as 10000.)
  (2005-02-02, HA)
- Bugfixed memalign() which was not exported as extern "C". this bug lead to
  crashes when freeing memory allocated by memalign(). Bug was reported by
  Grant Goodyear and Steven G. Johnson. Now defining macros/functions
  also for valloc()
  (2005-02-03, HA)

## 2.4.12 (2005-01-05)

- Added EF_NO_GLOBAL_MALLOC_FREE preprocessor flag to workaround buggy
  environments: no malloc(), free(), realloc(), calloc() are put into the
  global name-space of the efence library, thus only files which include
  efence.h call the efence malloc(),.. replacement functions. This flag
  is also helpful where linking order cannot get controlled e.g. when
  memory is allocated from a library not using efence but free is
  called from efence using efence. this is a problem when using
  DLL libraries which are linked against msvcrt.dll and its
  malloc/free under MS Windows. The same problem applies
  when libstdc++ / libgcc is not linked in correct order
  (2005-01-04, HA)

## 2.4.11 (2005-01-03)

- Bugfixed signal handling in confidence test (eftest), which lead to false
  errors with my newly installed Mandrake Linux 10.1
  (2005-01-03, HA)
- Bugfixed checking at free(), when EF_PROTECT_BELOW flag changed which lead
  to false positives
- Bugfixed error message output to stderr: length of messages were calculated
  too short. fixed functions EF_Abort() and EF_Exit()
  (2004-08-15, HA)

## 2.4.10 (2004-07-21)

- Added preprocessor macros for CA_DECLARE, CA_DEFINE, CA_REF in efence.h
  for declaration, definition and reference to Checked Arrays. These macros
  allow checks of arrays which are allocated on stack, but they are very
  slow on references cause every reference has to be checked
- Added EF_ASSERT() which definitely halts (for debugging)
- Precompiled headers have to be switched off in MS Visual C++ to get all the
  C++ operators to work, but don't ask me why!
- Implemented all the various new/delete/new[]/delete[] C++ operators. The
  implementations are not C++ conform concerning their behavior added type
  mismatch detection between malloc()/free(), new/delete, new[]/delete[]
  This is deactivated when EF_NO_LEAKDETECTION is set
- Added EF_MALLOC_FAILEXIT parameter. (for now not implemented)
- Extended semantics of EF_PROTECT_FREE
- Added EF_MAX_ALLOC parameter
- Bugfix: why should we ever use Page_Delete() when setting up the
  "dead" page?
- Bugfix: EF_PROTECT_FREE did exactly the opposite of that, what it should
  do up from Bruce's version 2.2.2 maybe earlier
  (2004-07-16, HA)
- Confidence test now PASS again
- Removed problems when used EF_NO_LEAKDETECTION preprocessor flag
- Makefile to work again, also included automatic generation of
  efence_config.h
- Added automatic generation and inclusion of efence_config.h instead
  function Page_Size()
  (2004-07-15, HA)
- Added code for thread safety: Only one thread at once is allowed to enter
  some internal functions. This can be deactivated using the
  EF_NO_THREAD_SAFETY preprocessor flag. There may be flaws concerning
  threads, when using the c++ operators for leak detection: use the
  EF_NO_LEAKDETECTION preprocessor flag if you encounter problems!
- Some files (page.c and print.c) have turned to header files, the needed
  functions are now declared static and are no more visible outside
  efence.c this way the NDEBUG preprocessor flag has been replaced by
  EF_NO_EFENCE, EF_NO_CPP_SUPPORT - be careful not to include
  efence in your release builds!
  (2004-03-21, HA)

## 2.4.9 (2002-12-05)

- Added checks for no mans land (= space which cannot get protected from the
  MMU): this area gets filled with EF_FILL on allocation, and gets checked
  on deallocation
  (2002-12-05, HA)

## 2.4.8 (2002-12-04)

- One big fix and many improvements for C++ code. old macros NEW_ELEM,
  NEW_ARRAY were not usable when allocating classes, which have
  constructor/destructor. The usage of these macros has not changed
  (See 2.4.3)
  (2002-12-04, HA)

## 2.4.7 (2002-11-22)

- Support Borland Free Command-line Tools: Borland C++ Builder 5.5
  - Throw away unnecessary declarations of malloc(), free(), etc.
    Borland didn't like them, and neither MS-Visual C++ 6.0 nor gcc
    (Dev-C++) needs them
  - Added project files in subdir "win32-vide" for VIDE 1.24 using
    Borland C++ Builder 5.5 (see http://www.objectcentral.com)
    (2002-11-22, HA)

## 2.4.6 (2002-11-18)

- Remove memory leak in eftest
- Allow re-inclusion of efence.h after inclusion of efenceint.h
- Added some project files in subdir "win32-devcpp" for Dev-C++ 4.9.6
  using gcc (see http://www.bloodshed.net) and saved its generated
  makefiles left tstheap's memory leaks
  (2002-11-18, HA)

## 2.4.5 (2002-11-17)

- Modifications in print routines (EF_Print, EF_Abort, ...)
- Added direct output to visual C++ debug output window
- Some additions to Makefile
  (2002-11-17, HA)

## 2.4.4 (2002-11-03)

- Separation of C++ files: efencepp.h, efencepp.cpp
- Rename EF_push()/EF_pop() to EF_newFrame()/EF_delFrame()
- Add new compile option "EF_NO_LEAKDETECTION"
- Add new compile option "EF_NO_CPP"
- Split efence.h to efence.h and efenceint.h
- Add Copyright and License information to many files
- Rename COPYING to COPYING-GPL
  (2002-11-03, HA)

## 2.4.3 (2002-10-08)

- Added following preprocessor Macros for Release and Debug Mode
  - #define NEW_ELEM(TYPE) new TYPE
  - #define NEW_ARRAY(TYPE,COUNT) new (TYPE)[COUNT]
  - #define DEL_ELEM(PTR) delete PTR
  - #define DEL_ARRAY(PTR) delete []PTR
    which are mapped to malloc() and free() in Debug Mode
- Use these macros to get file name and line number of a C++ style memory leak
  (2002-10-08, HA)

## 2.4.2 (2002-10-07)

- Added support for implicit and explicit leak checking:
  - void EF_push(void) creates a new memory frame
  - void EF_pop(void) checks for memory leaks allocated after EF_push();
    this function is called automatically onexit(), even without
    EF_push()
    (2002-10-07, HA)

## 2.4.1 (2002-10-06)

- Port to Windows (NT/2000/XP) by adding sections to following functions:
  - Page_AllowAccess()
  - Page_Create()
  - Page_Delete()
  - Page_DenyAccess()
  - Page_Size()
    (2002-10-06, HA)

## 2.4.0 (2002-10-03)

- Added support for C++ operators new, new[], delete and delete[]
- Added some project files in subdir "win32-msvc" for MS-Visual C++ 6.0
  (2002-10-03, HA)

## 2.2.2

- Shared library must be position-independent code

## 2.2.0

- Merge in bug-fixes, multi-thread patch, shared library patch, debian/
  sub-directory used for building the Debian package

## 2.0.5 (1995-01-20)

- Port to Linux
  (1995-01-20)

## 2.0.4 (1994-09-30)

- When realloc is passed a zero address, it should work the same way as
  malloc(). Fix forward declaration of mprotect() in page.c to use void \*,
  not caddr_t, for addresses. IRIX 5.0.1 complained about that
  (1994-09-30)

## 2.0.3 (1993-05-29)

- Don't attempt to allow access to a zero-sized page when
  EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0 is set
- Attempt to un-map memory from Page_Delete(). If that doesn't work, fall
  back by protecting the page from all references. Un-mapping small
  segments of a mapping used to crash my SGI IRIX 5.0 system. I assume
  that nobody is running 5.0 any longer
  (1993-05-29)

## 2.0.2

- Add support for DEC Alpha. Add %a pattern for printing addresses, which
  assumes they are passed in a void \*

## 2.0.1

- Add work-arounds for kernel and library bugs under HP-UX
  - HP has been notified and will repair these soon
