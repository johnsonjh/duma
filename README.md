#### Introduction

After deciding it was important to revive D.U.M.A., it quickly became clear
continued use of the `cvs` version control system would be a limiting factor to
the success of a new D.U.M.A. distribution. If the project was going to survive
in the long-term, it would be necessary to perform a full conversion to a more
modern, commonly used, and accessible VCS system.

Unaware of the efforts of the
[original author](https://github.com/hayguen/duma), I created this repository
independently, and expended much effort to identify all contributors and authors
of the many patches and contributions that had been produced by the community
over many years. After many false starts, I'm now mostly satisfied with the end
result - especially considering that many of my conclusions turned out to be
very close (and sometimes identical) to those made in the original author's own
conversion efforts. It should be noted that I had no special knowledge of this
software, besides being a user, and no relationship or even any previous contact
with the author.

The most time consuming part of the conversion process was determining all the
non-canonical changes, figuring out who actually wrote them, and finally
deciding if these patches should be incorporated into a new official "mainline"
repository.

This process required more than a few "educated guesses", and, when the
necessary details were not available, simple judgment calls. With such an old,
widely distributed, and hacked-upon code-base, which survived as long as it did,
without an official maintainer or source for new releases for many years, much
of data available is fragmentary and conflicting. Sometimes, the only sources of
information are the often fading memories of those originally involved with
project. Often, inferences had to be made, usually based on incomplete and
inaccurate information.

Because of these uncertainties, I am certain that mistakes have been made and
new errors introduced. I welcome any contributions from the public that would
help to make the repository more historically accurate as well as improve
functionality.

#### The Future of D.U.M.A.

A large task, not yet complete, is reconciling this reconstruction against the
last version which was released by the
[original author](https://github.com/hayguen/duma). The intention is to focus on
correctly identifying any significant deviations, especially in regardings to
the identification of contributors, and ensuring that any disputes that might
arise are fairly handled. As new information becomes available, the commit logs
for the project will be updated to provide an accurate record for posterity.

The structure of this conversion very closely resembles that of the original
`cvs` repository. In contrast, the orignal author's conversion efforts included
a radical refactoring the source tree and directory structures. I believe that
this was a prudent decision, and eventually plan to incorporate similar
restructuring in this repository.

While every attempt was been made to ensure correctness, especially when
acknowledging contributors, extracting information where available from the
original SourceForge site, random web forums, other `cvs`, `svn`, and, `git`
repositories, and mailing lists archives, this release does incorporate changes
that were never part of the original work, mostly to ensure compatability with
modern systems operating systems and environments.

#### Official D.U.M.A.?

This repository should be considered the "official" source for D.U.M.A.
releases.

Hayati Ayguen, the original author, is no longer actively maintaining D.U.M.A.
and has moved on to other projects. While he was happy to correspond about the
project, it seems unlikely that he will take on the role of primary maintainer
of the package.

---

#### History

D.U.M.A. started out as a fork of Bruce Perens' venerable "Electric Fence", a
tool created at Pixar, back in 1987.

D.U.M.A. was ported to Linux as early as 1992.

---

#### Conclusion

Now, almost 30 years later, we thank to Hayati Ayguen and all other
contributors, who put time and effort into this project, but allow them move on
to other endeavours. They can do so knowing that D.U.M.A. is not gone or
forgotten. Even though it is a mature software and package, it will be properly
maintained and updated as needed.

#### Addendum

For some additional information on the history of D.U.M.A. and Electric Fence,
see <https://perens.com/2017/04/04/my-30th-anniversary-in-open-source/>, for
short blog entry by Bruce Perens' mentioning the creation of his Electric Fence
tool.

The orginal author, [Hayati Ayguen](https://github.com/hayguen), remains an
active developer.
